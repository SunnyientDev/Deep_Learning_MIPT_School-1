        "Imagine that you have many different libraries, and all of them have their own versions (some are older, others are newer). Often, many libraries depend on others, and there may be many such dependencies, and depending on the version of the library. Thus, two different libraries may require two different versions of the same library (A and B depend on Cv0.1 and Cv0.2) on which they depend.\n",
        "To solve this issue, use **virtual environments (virtual environments)**. These are special utilities that, when launched, activate an environment isolated from the system, in which those and only those libraries and programs that you download there are located, and precisely in those versions in which you need. That is, the solution to the problem in this case is as follows: a venv1 is created, within which libraries A and Cv0.1, and venv2 within which libraries B and Cv0.2 are created. Thus, you seem to have created two mini-copies of your file system (roughly speaking), and installed the necessary versions of the packages in each one.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, you can set up a virtual environment in [conda](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html), or [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/)"
